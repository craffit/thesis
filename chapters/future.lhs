The research in this work presents a formal system for program transformation on a very high level, but a lot of work still needs to be done before this idea can be applied in the real world. The work that still has to be done can roughly be separated into two main areas: looking at language extensions and working toward an implementation. The upcoming two sections will highlight some questions that may be beneficial to each of these areas.

\section{Language extensions}
Although the most vital language extensions of recursion and polymorphism are covered in this work, there are many more features which exist in real-world programming language. How each of these features can be adapted to work with type and transform systems is a big source of future work.

\paragraph{Parametrized datatypes}
Most functional programming languages allow types to be parametrized by other types. This poses two important challenges. First off, types may be changed within the parameters of a parametrized data type. Furthermore, one would want to change parametrizable types, such as the |List a| and |Stream a| in the stream fusion example. In this case the |List| should be changed to a |Stream| regardless of the type parameter.

How transformations for such datatypes can be done and for what datatypes the semantics can be preserved is still an open question. Data types can have many features in themselves, such as nested data types and GADTs and it is not clear how these features interact with the type and transform system. It could be that simply maintaining the retraction property is enough to guarantee the equivalence properties on such datatypes, but this is not yet proven.

\paragraph{Type Classes}
Type classes language feature allow the implementation of polymorphic functions to be determined by the type with which they are used. Changing a type here would change behaviour of the polymorphic function, something which does usually not happen. How to account for this in the context of type and transform systems has yet to be researched.

\paragraph{Let-polymorphism proof}
Although we did a proof by handwaving for the let-polymorphic lambda calculus, this proof should also be formalized. Johann and VoigtlÃ¤nder ~\cite{johann09} give a logical relation for Haskell's underlying base language Core, which is based on the polymorphic lambda calculus. Based on this work it should be possible to prove or disprove the correctness of the let-polymorphic type and transform system.

\paragraph{Generic Transformation System}
We have seen that a type and transform system can readily be derived from the object language, as long as it has a typing system and has well-defined deduction rules. It may be possible to mathematically formulate the mechanism with which a type and transform system can be constructed. This would require a structural characterization of the eligible object languages and a procedure with which the type and transform system can be derived. This might even lead to a generic proof of correctness for all derivable programming languages.

\section{Implementation}
When looking at the implementation of type and transform systems there are two main topics to be researched: developing efficient algorithms for transformation and integrating the transformation system into existing infrastructure in a user-friendly and maintainable way.

\paragraph{Efficient implementation}
Naively generating all possible transformation results will result in a slow transformation system. Developing efficient algorithms and heuristics is of essential importance for a real-world application. Not only should transformation be fast, but transformation should also produce the 'best' of all possible results. How to perform good and fast transformations is ongoing research by Sean Leather.

\paragraph{GHC Core-To-Core Transformations}
Recent version of the GHC Haskell compiler allow the user to specify transformation passes. These transformation passes are performed on a typed intermediate language called Core. The Core language is designed to be a simple, desugared functional language upon which optimizations and transformations can be performed, which makes it an ideal candidate for implementation of a type and transform system. The Core language has some specific characteristics such as type coercions which should first be researched in the context of type and transform systems.

\paragraph{Monoid Transformation}
The monoid transformation could implemented as a separate transformation to optimize the evaluation of monoidal structures. The monoidal transformation can take an arbitrary binary operation and transform a program such that the binary operator is only applied to its left or right argument. A simple user annotation could specify in which way the application nesting should be transformed, such as a fixity declaration:

> infixl 5 (++)
